# Timeline Map

Getting its data from the Harvard Art Museums API, this project places all of the works currently on view in the museums along a timeline of when they went on view. Objects for which there is geolocation data appear on a world map, color coded by classification, while the gallery they're going up in display along the side. The visualization is controlled by mobile device.

### To run this project, open http://timeline-map.herokuapp.com/index.html in a web browser, and http://timeline-map.herokuapp.com/control.html in one or mobile mobile devices.
