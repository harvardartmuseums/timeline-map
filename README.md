# Timeline Map

Getting its data from the Harvard Art Museums API, this project places all of the works currently on view in the museums along a timeline of when they went on view. Objects for which there is geolocation data appear on a world map, color coded by classification, while the gallery they're going up in display along the side. The visualization is controlled by mobile device.

### Installation

npm install 
```

## Possible to-dos
